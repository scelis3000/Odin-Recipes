      <h3>Description</h3>
      <div class="section">
        <p>
          If you're not using a high-protein pasta, you can double the protein
          per serving by adding 8 ounces cooked and sliced chicken breast.
          Double the sauce in Step 1 to keep the dish creamy.

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <div class="section">
        <ul>
          <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
          <li>Â½ cup chopped onion</li>
          <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <div class="section">
        <ol>
          <li>
            Heat oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and garlic;
            cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is tender, 3 to 4 minutes.
            Stir in cauliflower and broth; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and
            simmer, covered, until tender, about 15 minutes. Uncover and let
            cool slightly. Transfer to a food processor. Add cheese, water, and
            black pepper. Cover and pulse until smooth.
          </li>
          <li>
            Meanwhile, cook pasta according to package directions, adding
            broccoli and bell pepper the last 5 minutes. Drain, reserving 1/2
            cup cooking water.
          </li>
          <li>
            Return pasta mixture to pot and stir in cauliflower sauce. Heat
            through, stirring in reserved cooking water (if needed) to reach
            desired consistency. Garnish with basil, zest (if using), lemon
            juice, and additional cheese.
